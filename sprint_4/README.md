# Embeddings

This repository contains various types of text embeddings for natural language processing tasks. Below is a list of available embeddings:

## Word2Vec Embeddings

Word2Vec is a popular word embedding technique that represents words in a continuous vector space.

- **Description:** Word2Vec embeddings are trained using the Word2Vec algorithm on a large corpus of text data.
- **Usage:** These embeddings can be used for a wide range of NLP tasks, such as word similarity, document classification, and more.
- 
## Glove Embeddings

GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is another widely used word embedding method.

- **Description:** GloVe embeddings are pre-trained vectors that capture global word co-occurrence statistics.
- **Usage:** These embeddings can be utilized for various NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.

## BERT Embeddings

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model.

- **Description:** BERT embeddings are contextualized word embeddings that consider the surrounding words in a sentence.
- **Usage:** BERT embeddings are highly useful for tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering.

## Sentence Embeddings

Sentence embeddings aim to capture the semantic meaning of entire sentences or documents.

- **Description:** Sentence embeddings represent the semantic content of sentences and can be used for various text similarity and classification tasks.
- **Usage:** These embeddings are beneficial for tasks like document clustering, sentiment analysis, and more.
